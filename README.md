This is still very much a work in progress.
Nonetheless, I share it in case it might be of interest to others.
If anyone is interested in this analysis, email me (jeromy.anglim@deakin.edu.au) any questions and I'll try to add some more documentation.

In general, the starting point is to open the `Rproj` file in Rstudio and then open `reports/bayesian.rmd`. The project is organised using the ProjectTemplate package.
